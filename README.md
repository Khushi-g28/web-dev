<h3>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. It encompasses a range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to defend against cyber threats, including malware, phishing, and data breaches. Effective cybersecurity relies on a multi-layered approach, involving both technological solutions and human awareness to mitigate risks. 
Here's a more detailed look:
Key Aspects of Cybersecurity:
Protecting Systems and Networks:
